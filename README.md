# Weather-Application


## Descirption 
I created this weather app to allow a user to search a city and get the current weather and the 5-day forecast. The user can see the current temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The user can also see the projected 5-day forecast that also shows the tempertature, wind speed, and humidity data points. The application focuses on the current weather temp and then displays a smaller 5-day forecast. A user can also pass in previous searched cities to represent the data.

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage
The weather application was created to check the weather and 5-day forecast. A user can use it once they are curious of the weather and want the 5-day forecast. The user simply has to input a city and then the forecast will appear. 
The weather app can be found at: https://luis00809.github.io/Weather-Application/

## Credits
I had to use the find ai website to look up how to get current and forceasted dates as well as to reusing the search history button. I didn't know how to have if the button is clicked then its current and forecasted weather would be displayed.
